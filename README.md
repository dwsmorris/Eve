Eve is a programming language and IDE based on years of research into building a human-first programming platform. You can play with Eve online here: [play.witheve.com](http://play.witheve.com/).

## Installation

### From Source

You'll need a recent [node.js](https://nodejs.org) for your platform. Download the Eve source either by cloning this repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/witheve/Eve.git
```

or you can [download](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/archive/master.zip) the Eve source directly. To build and run Eve, run the following commands in the root Eve directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

### From Docker

First, [download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) and install Docker for your platform. To download and install the Eve container, run the following command:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 witheve/eve
```

## How to use Eve

You can learn about Eve with the following resources:

- [Play with Eve in your browser](http://play.witheve.com/) (use Chrome for best results)
- [Syntax Quick Reference](https://witheve.github.io/assets/docs/SyntaxReference.pdf)
- [Eve Language Handbook (draft)](http://docs.witheve.com)

*Please let us know what kind of documents would be the most helpful as you begin your journey with Eve*. We want our documentation to be a highlight of the Eve experience, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

### Running programs on Node.js

By default, Eve serves the IDE with the browser as the runtime (executing the program).
To instead have the program execute on the server-side, in Node.js use:

```
npm start -- --server
```

### How to Contribute

The best way to contribute right now is to write Eve code and report your experiences. Let us know what kind of programs you’re trying to write, what barriers you are facing in writing code (both mental and technological), and any errors you encounter along the way. Also, let us know what you love! What features are your favorite?

Another way to really help us is to host your `*.eve` files on Github, so we can get Eve recognized as an official language in the eyes of Github. Be sure to also send us a link to your repo!

## Disclaimer

Eve is currently at a very early, "alpha" stage of development. This means the language, tools, and docs are largely incomplete, but undergoing rapid and continuous development. If you encounter errors while using Eve, don't worry: it's likely our fault. Please bring the problem to our attention by [filing an issue](https://github.com/witheve/eve#how-to-file-an-issue).

As always, with pre-release software, don’t use this for anything important. We are continuously pushing to this codebase, so you can expect very rapid changes. At this time, we’re not prepared make the commitment that our changes will not break your code, but we’ll do our best to [update you](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) on the biggest changes.
